Hi, I'm Dilay 👋 

I'm a French national of Turkish descent, born in Brive in 2001. I lived there for 3 years, before my family eventually moved to Paris; I ended up growing up in the French capital, while going back to my country of origin once a year or even biannually. I then moved out to London in September 2019 for my undergraduate studies but had to go back to Paris when the COVID-19 pandemic worsened (studying and working part-time & remotely). After a mentally and academically challenging few months, I'm now super excited to be back in London!

I'm currently an undergraduate student at UCL (going into my third year), studying an Integrated Master of Science in Psychology and Language Sciences, which is an interdisciplinary degree at the intersection of the following areas: psychology, linguistics, neuroscience & maths/statistics (with R).

### More Information

I'm interested in neuroscience, especially its computational and cognitive subfields, and artificial intelligence. 
What excites me the most is the application of computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to research in neuroscience and cognitive science, which is exactly what I aspire to pursue after my undergraduate studies.

### Location

Current: Paris, France
