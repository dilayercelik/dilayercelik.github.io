Hi, I'm Dilay ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a French national of Turkish descent, born in a small town of France in 2001; I lived there for 3 years, before my family moved to Paris (which is where I grew up). I then moved on my own to London in September 2019 for my undergraduate studies. I went back to Paris when the COVID-19 pandemic worsened, studying and working part-time & remotely; after a mentally and academically challenging year, I'm now super excited to be back in London!

I'm currently an undergraduate student at UCL (going into my third year), studying an Integrated Master of Science in Psychology and Language Sciences, an interdisciplinary degree spanning the following areas: psychology, linguistics, neuroscience & maths/statistics (with R).

### More Information

I'm interested in neuroscience, especially its computational and cognitive subfields, and artificial intelligence. 
What excites me the most is the application of computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to research in neuroscience and cognitive science, which is exactly what I aspire to pursue after my undergraduate studies.

### Location

Current: Paris, France
