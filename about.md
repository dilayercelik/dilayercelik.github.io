Hi, I'm Dilay ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Turkish, I was born in France and grew up in Paris, before heading to London for my undergraduate studies (2019-2023).

I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCL (sophomore), studying Psychology and Language Sciences.

### More Information

I'm interested in neuroscience, especially its computational and cognitive subfields, and Artificial Intelligence. 
What excites me the most is the application of computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to research in neuroscience, which is also what I aspire to pursue after my undergraduate studies.

### Location

Current: Paris, France

Other: 
- London, UK
