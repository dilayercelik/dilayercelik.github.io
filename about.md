I'm a second-year undergraduate student at UCL, studying Psychology and Language Sciences.

### More Information

I'm interested in neuroscience, especially its computational and cognitive subfields, and Artificial Intelligence. 
What excites me the most is the application of computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to research in neuroscience, which I also what I aspire to pursue after my undergraduate studies.
