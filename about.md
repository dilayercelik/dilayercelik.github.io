Hi, I'm Dilay ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Turkish :) I was born in a small town of France; I lived there for 3 years, before moving to Paris (which is where I grew up). I then moved to London in September 2019 for my undergraduate studies. I'm now back in Paris (COVID-19), studying and working part-time remotely.

I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at UCL (sophomore), studying an Integrated Master of Science in Psychology and Language Sciences, focusing on the following areas: psychology, linguistics, neuroscience & maths/statistics (with R).

### More Information

I'm interested in neuroscience, especially its computational and cognitive subfields, and Artificial Intelligence. 
What excites me the most is the application of computational tools and machine learning/deep learning techniques to research in neuroscience and cognitive science, which is also what I aspire to pursue after my undergraduate studies.

### Location

Current: Paris, France
